        <h1>LOVE HAPPENS</h1>
        <p>Love is the fuel that ignites our passions, the melody that harmonizes our souls. 
            in its purest form, love propels us to conquer obstacles, <br /> 
            inspires resilience, and paints 
            the world with vibrant hues of joy. <br />
            Embrace love, let it be your guilding light, and watch as it transforms 
            every corner of your existence into a masterpiece
            of happiness.</p>
            <p>
                “You know you’re in love when you can’t fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.” – Dr. Seuss <br />
                “I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close.” – Pablo Neruda <br />
                “Love is like the wind, you can’t see it but you can feel it.” – Nicholas Sparks <br />
               <p> “Love is the magician that pulls man out of his own hat.” – Ben Hecht
                “The best love is the kind that awakens the soul; that makes us reach for more, that plants the fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds. That’s what I hope to give you forever.” – Noah from The Notebook</p>
